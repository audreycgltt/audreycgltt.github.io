Passionate about computers and machines since my childhood, I started my path by doing a 2-year university diploma in Electrical Engineering and Industrial Computing followed by an engineering diploma.

Beyond doing computer stuff, I enjoy cooking, drawing comic strips, doing Crossfit, and recently, 3D modeling and printing.
