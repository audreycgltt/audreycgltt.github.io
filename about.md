<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>Passionate about computers and machines since my childhood, I used to dream about making the world a better place using new technologies. This interest in this field led me to start learning how to code by myself as a teenager and then study electrical and computer engineering with the aim of turning my passions into a professional career.</p>

<p>Today, not much has changed, except the exciting journey I’m on. After spending two years as a back-end developer at Metron, where I helped reduce energy costs and the carbon footprint of companies using AI, I joined the amazing team at Enchanted Tools</p>

<p>Here, I am working on creating fluid, magical interactions between humans and robots, where the robots aren’t just machines but have personalities of their own. Every interaction feels real, bringing us closer to a future where robots are not just tools, but allies.</p>

<p>Even in my spare time, I tend to continue writing code at home in order to give life to my wildest ideas using my hardware background by making fun and stupid stuff with microcontrollers, servo motors, and LEDs.</p>

<p>Beyond doing computer stuff, I enjoy drawing comic strips, doing Crossfit, and recently, 3D modeling and printing.</p>
