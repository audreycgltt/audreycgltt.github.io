Big air hockey table even bigger with 2 huge servo motors added and an HD camera positioned on top of it. The goal? Not to take any from the human player! The puck was tracked with the camera and the automaton should respond accordingly to the trajectory and the speed. 

The automation was made using Ladder, Grafcet and Structured Text.
