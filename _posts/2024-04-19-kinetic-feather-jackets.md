> Girl, I have a MET Gala theme party, could you do something?

This is what looks like one of the best whatsapp message I ever received.
Have I ever dreamed to make something wore for the MET Gala? Yes.
Do I care if it's not for the real Gala? No.

No need to say more, that girl is all in!

But what to do? So much ideas came to my mind : LEDs shirt ? Too simple. Optic fibers? Meh, done that already. Smoke machine with a dragon statue? A bit too costy (I had a budget).
Nah, I wanted to use servos. You know, the ones that I bought some years ago, sitting in a box crawled by dust, thinking I would find the perfect project for them. Well, that's it!

I kept wondering about what could I do for weeks until the idea came while watching JoJo's bizarre Adventure, seeing Dio's magificient coat with feathers:

Now, imagine the same spirit on a suit jacket (the event took place in April) but with oscillating feathers? Perfection.
