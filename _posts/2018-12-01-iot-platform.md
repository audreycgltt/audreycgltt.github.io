Showcase platform aimed to connect to different types of sensors (temperature, humidity, etc.) and retrieve their values when needed, to be used at the FÃªte de la Science (french annual event of scientific culture) organized at the University of Technology of Troyes. 

In the beginning, the platform was supposed to be controlled by a mobile app but I thought that voice control would be more fun. So, the voice application was powered by Snips on a raspberry pi, values requests and results were sent via MQTT using the raspi as the broker and some esp32 (programmed with Arduino IDE) publishing and subscribing to messages.
