Kind of my favourite one, I present to you MAKI the robot. 

It was at first a simple 3D printed robotic face able to move using six servo motors. The objective was to give it more personality and skills to be able to mimic emotion in order to teach autistic children to develop social abilities. For that, we redesigned some 3D parts in order to include cameras in the eyes, eyebrows and jaws. 

The controller used was a NI myRio board so all the programming was done using LabVIEW.
