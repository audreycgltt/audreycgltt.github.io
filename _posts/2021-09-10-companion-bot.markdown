I always dream to have my own personal robot, but tired of waiting, I decided to directly create mine! This desk robot will be able to react to notifications from my agenda, Twitter, and more.

Really simplistic project, in order to learn CAD along the way, it will be fully 3D printed at home. Itâ€™s aimed to evolve through time with more features along the way. For now, I've managed to print and code the first beta version and currently making some arrangements.
