I always dream to have my own personal robot, but tired of waiting, I decided to directly create mine! This desk robot will be able to react to notifications from my agenda, Twitter, and more. Depending on the time of the day and settings, it will react by moving its head around and bouncing LEDS around its body (yes, you can definitely see a K2000 reference here).

The parts are simple: an LEDs strip (w2812b), one servo (SG90), a buzzer and two googly eyes, all synchronized with an ESP8266. 

Really simplistic project, in order to learn CAD along the way (with fusion360), it will be fully 3D printed at home. Itâ€™s aimed to evolve through time with more features along the way. For now, I've managed to print and code the first beta version and currently building again the 3D model entirely for it to be more beautiful :)

For now, this little guy doesn't have a name and is looking for one!
