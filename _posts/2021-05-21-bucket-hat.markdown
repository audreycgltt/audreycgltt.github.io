I love kitschy objects. I love LEDs. So here comes the illuminated bucket hat! But there’s a time when LEDs aren’t enough to fulfil my passion anymore… So, it is also sound reactive! Composed of LEDs, an esp32, an INMP401 microphone (using i²s) and (of course) a bucket hat. Everything is soldered on a simple perfboard, I use a simple powerbank in order to power it. 

The sound visualization effect was originally made using homemade FFT but I switched to use an alternative version of WLED that can allow me to directly control it with my phone and access to a bunch of lighting effects.

I sew a black "steath" around LEDs for them to be unoticeable when the hat is off.
