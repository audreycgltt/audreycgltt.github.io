Vocal assistant skill powered by Snips about zythology ("beer culture").

It is based on the old data of OpenBeerDB. You can now ask your favourite assistant for some information about a specific beer (the style, its description, ABV, IBU or SRM) and then add it to your favourites! Moreover, you can ask what type of food will be
the best with a beer or, on the other side, ask which style of beer would be perfect with your tonight's meal. It will suggest to you in priority the beers that you added into your favourites.

Unfortunately, Snips vocal assistant isnâ€™t available anymore but it was a
fun project to discover the possibilities of voice control using Python
and databases.
