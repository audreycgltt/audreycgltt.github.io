What is it? A connected Santa Claus hat! 

What is it called? Le ProtoBonnet!

Why? This hat has been created entirely for the [NoÃ«l des protopotes](https://www.protopotes.stream/noel/) a special livestream event happening on the 27th of December, 2021.

## But, why?

For their first collaboration, Les protopotes decided to organised a christmas twitch stream. The live is hosted by [Neodyme](https://www.twitch.tv/ioodyme) and [Kathleen](https://www.twitch.tv/KathleenFabric) (aka Daddy and Mommy Christmas) from Switzerland. The goal was to create 6 connected costume parts that could interact with the live and people in the chat. 

I was part of the team making Kathleen's hat, along with [Tix le Geek](https://tixlegeek.io/) and [Hippo](http://les-ateliers-de-hippo.fr/).

We had the idea to create a hat with two eyes and white fabric in orter to change its color while reacting to events, and also launch two quizzes directly on twitch. 

I was personnally charged to sew the hat, make the electronics and program it in order for it to react to MQTT messages.

Viewers can trigger actions and commands through a dedicated web interface in exchange of protopoints (currency created for the event that can be obtained in exchange of Twitch channel points).

You can find the code on [github](https://github.com/audreycgltt/protobonnet).
