Showcased at the IFA 2019, the intention was to demonstrate the possibilities of Snips, this time with a GUI. 

We imagined a totally voice-controlled kitchen with appliances that could communicate together, possible actions included: fridge &
refrigerator control, stove control, timers, shopping list, etc.

The GUI has been made using Crank Software, running on a central raspberry Pi with the vocal assistant.
