As a teen addicted to video games, I had to learn one day how to create a one. So when La [d√©veloppeuse du Dimanche](https://twitter.com/dev_dimanche), an independant video game maker making videos on YouTube, announced that she was organising its first game jam in august 2019, it was an evidence! 

I enrolled myself, started to learn C# and Unity and two weeks later I was part of a team trying to make my first game!

The result is [Lousion](https://reddozer.itch.io/louison), a dream exploration game available on itch.io.
